# Dotfiles
My various config files

Gives you something that looks like this:

This is:
* [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) + [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks)
* [rofi](https://davedavenport.github.io/rofi/)
* [urxvt](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html)
* [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) (with [oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh))
* [vim](http://www.vim.org/) (with [airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) and the Roboto font from the [patched font project](https://github.com/powerline/fonts))

All running on top of [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)

**Note [0]:** To get the icons used all over the shop working, you'll need to install [font awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) as I've used that quite heavily...

**Note [1]:** The Xmonad configs, .xmoobarrc, .Xdefaults and .muttrc are not in use, but I've left them here in case they're useful to anyone...
